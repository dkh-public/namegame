This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## To run this application:

Clone or check out this repo to your local device. Once saved, run "npm install", then "npm start".
This runs the game in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.<br />

## About the project

This game was developed using React.js from specs provided by WillowTree. The purpose of this project is to highlight my coding skills and abilities. My development background is primarily in ColdFusion, Javascript and jQuery, but I felt React would be a better library to use for this particular application. While I am fairly new to using React, I am pleased with the results. 

## Application highlights

Some of the NPM packages I used in the functionality of the game are:<br />

* **random-n:** This selects random items from an array. I used this to get the six options from the JSON API, then again to get a single "answer" option form the subset. I felt this was more efficient than getting the answer first, then trying to get five other options without also selecting the already-chosen answer among the options subset.<br />

* **React Router:** This package allowed me to use URLs to navigate to various components rather than having everything running under the root, which made testing difficult. <br />

* **React Bootstrap:** I have developed websites that use Bootstrap, so this was familiar territory for me. The "shorthand" syntax took some getting used to, but being familiar with the Bootstrap framework was helpful.<br />

## For futher development

There are some features I'd hoped to implement, like more complex image filtering, face recognition, dynamic image resizing, and a round timer.  I brainstormed a few ways to implement these using NPM packages I was researching, but I ran out of time to further develop these ideas. <br />

## Conclusion

In conclusion, I am very happy with the work done thus far on this project, and I look forward to talking through my coding thoughts and processes with the WillowTree team.
